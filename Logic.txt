Logic involved for important requests:

1. Add question (/addQA)
   When the survey creator adds a question, i have made an asumption that while adding the multiple choices, he also adds an 
   indicator against the correct answers. So that this data can be used to identify the correct answer for the survey put in 
   by the user.
   Note: Though this data is not used in any service, this can be used to provide the users with the number of correct answers.

2. Percentage distribution across the multiple choice answers for a particular question.

   Let's say for a question we have 3 multiple choice(a,b,c). And the user selects a,b.
   So number of answers selected : a =1 , b= 1, c =0
   Percentage distribution : a = (a*100)/(a+b+c) = 100/2 = 50%
                             b = 50%
                             c =  0%
   The above is correct when there is just one survey made.
   Now let's say there is a total of 3 surveys made by different user.
   Assume, each survey puts the answer as below:
   Survey 1 : Question One Answer -> a,b,c
   Survey 2 : Question One Answer -> a,b
   Survey 3 : Question One Answer -> a,c
   Total : a = 3, b = 2, c =2
   % Distribution of a = (3*100)/7 ~ 43%
   % Distribution of b = (2*100)/7 ~ 28%
   % Distribution of c = (2*100)/7 ~ 28%
